# newsreader

This is a little project I used to learn Flutter and Dart. It's just a simple
news reader that consumes news from my own news aggregator(Only German news :().
If you are new to Flutter, try adding something new or just clone the App.
It helped me immersively and maybe you too :)


## Getting Started

1. Download / Clone this repo
2. Run ```flutter pub get```
3. Start zour emulator or connect your real device
4. Run ```flutter run``` and have fun :)

## Design approach

I am not a professional designer, so bare with me :) I tried a minimalistic
approach that focuses on the content and images. And this was just for learning,
so I could have spent waaay more time on design.
